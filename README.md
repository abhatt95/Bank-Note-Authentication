# Bank-Note-Authentication

Using the KNN and its variant on UCI banknote authentication Data Set to classify the notes into Authentic or Fake. 
The project is mainly divided into following subsections. 

Undestanding Data

1. EDA
2. Splitting data into Train Test Set
3. Applying KNN 
- Using Euclidean distance
- Paramter Tuning 
- Plot of 1/k vs mean error
- Plot of k vs mean error
- Learning Curve 
4. Variants of KNN using different distance 
  - minkowski distance with p = 1 i.e. manhattan distance 
  - Chebyshev Distance 
  - Mahalanobis distance 
5. using distance as weights in making impact on class 
  - manhattan
  - euclidean
  - Chebyshev
